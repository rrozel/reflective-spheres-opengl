Ryan Rozelle - Programming Assignment 5, CS645; due Nov. 28, 2012

I set the initial illumination (color, or material) values for each sphere exactly as
given in the assignment: for example, yellow would be (1,1,0). For the reflective
floor, it has no initial value (everything it shows will only be a reflection), so
it starts with a 0 initial value (rather, it's black - (0,0,0)).

From there, when the rayTrace() function is using the illumination value at
an intersection (or collision) of a ray, if it is a primary ray, it takes the
full illumination value (0 if in shadow), then multiplies that by the "diffuse
ratio", that is, the cosine of the angle of the normal to the light source.
This value is then added to the product of (reflection ratio times reflection
value). Reflection ratio is .5 for most spheres, .7 for the polished one,
and 1.0 for the mirrored floor.
To this value I then add the "specular ratio" (or rather, the specular
ratio multiplied by white color, which is the same).

I made keypresses control the location of the camera, location of the
light source, and whether shadows are shown, in order to provide extra
features and allow the user to modify the scene to show different
lighting angles and parts of the scene.

I also determined through some quick trial-and-error that a specular exponent
of 7.0 was reasonable, and any higher did not show any improvement.

I set the resolution (RES) initially at 100, but upped it quickly to 300 (since
the canvas size is 550x300, it looked much better to fill it).

For the Phong illumination of the curtains, I used the following parameters:
ambient = {0.1, 1.0, 0.1} - Trial-and-error (green) parameter.
diffuse = {0.6, 0.8, 0.6} - Trial-and-error (green) parameter.
specular= {1.0, 1.0, 1.0} - For a white specular reflection.
shininess = {50.0} - About 50% shininess.
